# tb-quiz-game-project

As a Boot Camp Instructor I wish to create a timed quiz on CSS fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my student's progress compared to their peers.

A student begins to take the test

then they click a start button to begin the test

then a timer starts and they are presented with a question

when they answer a question

when the question is correct they are awarded points

then they are presented with another question

when they answer a question incorrectly

then they receive a time penalty which subtracts from their remaining time

when time runs out or all the questions are answered

the quiz is over

then they are given the option to save their information to join the leader board.
